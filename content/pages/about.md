      # Our story


      “In 2016 we saw that SME businesses were not getting the financial management and advice they deserved to grow their business. We met with countless digital, tech and professional services companies that weren’t quite ready for a full-time accounting team but still needed highly experienced accountants and advisors to guide them to greater success. 


      It became our mission to provide service-based SMEs with access to the financial processes, reporting and advisory support they deserve. Today we are proud to lead a team of talented advisors who support businesses across Australia to grow and prosper.” 


      – Trent & Ryan, TINKA founders
